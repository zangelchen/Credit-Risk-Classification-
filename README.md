# Credit Risk Classification
Credit Risk Classification using supervised machine learning

The objective is to use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk on a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company and build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


The results: 
- The logistic's model has a high accuracy score at 0.99 out of 1. It also has a precision score of 0.87, which indicates that this model has a pretty high chance at predicting the score for a high risk loan. 
- For background, a high precision score is important to indicate minimal false positives which can impact credibility with customer base while a high recall score is important for minimizing false negatives to hedge against financial losses.  
- The oversampled data has a higher accuracy score of 0.99 vs the previous 0.95. This means that logistical regression using oversampled data is more effective at identifying high risk loans with increased recall accuracy, leading to less financial losses and increased credibility to its customers. 

A summary: This analysis shows that the original data can be used to train and test the machine learning model with a high accuracy rate of 0.95 out of 1.0. However, random oversampling the data gets an even higher accuracy and recall scores (0.99 out of 1.0). It is recommended to use the latter dataset for better predictions and resolving any imbalanced sampling. With more accurate forecasts, firms can increase their reputation with consumers and decrease future financial losses.
